## Question Generation

This codebase is forked from [huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai](http://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai). You can find the original README in that repository.

## File Descriptions

1. `arguments.py` - A list of command line arguments for the accompanying codebase.
2. `train.py` - Minimalistic script to train the question generation model.
3. `interact.py` - Minimalistic script to get question generation predictions.
4. `dataloader.py` - Modules to load dataset and map to coarse-grained specificity.
